# The Prompt

This is an evemenu command and tool that helps players resolve and record
conflicts and challenges. Once triggered with a target it will ask the player
a series of questions about the target and the player's strategy or approach
to dealing with it. The players responses are recorded (and there will be 
some attempt to parse and collate the text) and saved in a journal. 

The final output of the prompt should simply be a string or data structure
to be sent to a journalling function. 

# Prompt Models
The prompt can be simple or complex.  The plan is to start as simple as we can
get away with and still be fun. 

# Prompt Modes
The idea is that to get best results players will need to build some habits
and develop some writing/authoring routines to use the right verb forms so 
that the collated journal will read nicely.  So at first a player will want
more guidance from the prompt to walk them through the input. Later a player
may find it faster and easier to have less guidance (less steps) when 
composing a stategy and a ruling. The way to build this in will be 'modes'.

# Model A
Model A (alpha) this model is the bare minimum for testing. It assumes all
players have builder privileges. For example if the player targets a
non-existent object the prompt will suggest the player create it if desired.
