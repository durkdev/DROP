# MUD within a MUD
So one concept I had was to make the purely random dungeon a special
location in another MUD. For discussion sake I'll call it Drowntown.

Picture this, you're innocently exploring a MUD, you're a big strapping
77th level Half-Dragon Exculpatator Devilkin Warlock.  However you step
through a portal and find yourself naked, alone, in a strange bedraggled
village surrounded by crude hovels. Or perhaps a sleazy deity sent you here
as a punishment or something, who knows. Anyways you learn that you are
a not the person you thought you were. You have no skills, no magic, no
half-dragon devilkin innate abilities. You are a zeroth level human with
nothing to your name. You learn the name of the town you're in is called
Drowntown. The locals seem to know nothing of the outside world. They are 
not cruel to you, but life is hard and everyone has to earn their keep.
bereft of any skills you will be condemmed to a life of menial hard labour
perhaps feeding the pigs, a job which will earn you a small share of their
slop and perhaps a corner of their sty in which to bed down at night. For
an accomplished hero like yourself a fate worse perhaps than death.

But you learn that at the edge of town there is an immense dungeon and 
though the villagers fear to even look at the place, they all whisper of
the great riches to be found inside. You think, there in lies my salvation
either I strike it rich and return here to a better quality of life, or I 
perish and let my bones join the corpses that already rot in that abyssal
tomb. In either event I win my freedom from the pigsty.

So you head into the Dungeon, weak, and helpless armed with nothing better
than your wits. This launches the random dungeon game. Inevitably you will 
die. Then a new aspect of this strange place is revealed to you. A grim 
reaper greets you and offers you a choice. You may escape this realm and
return to your life in the regular MUD as the 77th level Half-Dragon
Exculpatator Devilkin Warlock. No worse for the wear after your extra-
dimensional adventure. OR you could return to Drowntown once again. You
need only choose a new name and a fresh body will await you, naked and
alone once again in the pig sty. But once again you'll have the opportunity
to confront the great dungeon and perhaps this time prove yourself better
than the worst it has to throw at you.

Of course your pride will not let you shy away from this obvious challenge.
You eat the purple pill, or drink the bloody chalice, or swallow the worm
or whatever disgusting ritual is arbitrarily demanded of you and poof...
just as the Grim Harvester promised you're back in the muck. But this time
you've got a plan.

You head into the Dungeon, weak, helpless, and armed with nothing better 
than your wits, and obvious stubborn streak. Rinse, repeat... 

Eventually you return from the dungeon, alive carrying a sack of copper
pieces and a rusty cudgel you wrested from the cold dead grasp of a hapless
kobold. The villagers are mildly impressed and quickly offer you a variety 
of ways to part with your copper. For most of your haul the pig farmer offers
to let you upgrade your accomodations for the night, sleeping in the hayloft
instead of the much and thus help you recover some of your strength.

Another villager offers to sell you a ten foot pole to help you probe for
traps in the dungeon. Soon your wealth is depleted and you have no choice but 
to head back into the dark. Rinse, repeat...

One day, perhaps in this life or more likely half a dozen amusing deaths and
re-incarnations later you return from a dungeon delve with over a thousand
pieces of gold! The pig farmer offers to sell you the whole damn farm! If 
you accept you can settle down here, perhaps start a family, and in any case
make an honest living. You grow to love Drowntown and it's stodgy but 
genuine inhabitants. You are respected by others. You live to see many an 
interdimension ne'er do well make their sojourn through your pigsty and 
politely mourn their deaths in the Dungeon. One day, frail and decrepit after
a life of hard honest work as a scrupulous pig farmer you pass through the 
mortal vale while asleep in a sturdy hand-made bed. 

"Oh there you are!" mutters the Grim Mower, "took you long enough". So what's
it going to be this time.  Back to Drowntown again? Or are you ready to be 
a 77th level Half-Dragon Exculpatator Devilkin Warlock now?" 

That's a good question isn't it? Should you stop this nonsense and return to 
you pretigious Exculpatator duties in the regular MUD? But what if... what if
on your next life in Drowntown you found a stairway to the next level of the
Dungeon? What if you scored the big one?  Maybe you could really make a 
legend of yourself this time? Hmm? That would show the Grumpy Reaper a thing
or too? It would certainly make a better story back in your real life than
"I retired as a pig farmer in an alternate dimension".

And so off you go. But this time, upon your return to Drowntown you find
things slightly different. You still start out in a pig sty, but you recognize
the farmer is a grown up child you knew back in your last life here. They
do not recognize you of course. You also find the place is slightly more 
prosperous. The locals attribute this to the contributions of a well loved
deceased pig farmer. The market has slighty more useful things for sale. Now
if only you had the silver to buy them. Well then, back to the Dungeon!
