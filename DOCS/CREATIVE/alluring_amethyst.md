# In a dusty tomb...

## A low tunnel descends into the earth...

A giant stone centipede chews through the rock, waving its antenna menacingly. Its eighth spiracle is vulnerable.

A giant stone centipede
* spits dissolving venom
* snaps its forcipules
* secretes sticky wax
* clicks its mandibles
* rears on its hind legs
* twists its tergites

## A worn stone door hangs on rusty iron hinges...

A deranged graverobber hunches under his loot bag. He carries a tattered treasure map. 

A deranged graverobber
* cackles crazily
* stabs with a long ugly knife
* grins mischievously
* shuts his eyes tight
* strokes his long, white beard
* cringes pitifully

## Bones lie scattered around a sepulchral antechamber...

Long-dead artisans chiseled ancient script on the walls.

Ancient script
* reminds you of a book you read
* recalls a bard's tale heard long ago
* looks like the engraving on a sword blade you saw once
* glows in the dim light
