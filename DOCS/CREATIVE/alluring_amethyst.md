# In a dusty tomb...

## A low tunnel descends into the earth...

A giant stone centipede chews through the rock, waving its antenna menacingly. Its eighth spiracle is vulnerable.

A giant stone centipede
* spits dissolving venom
* snaps its forcipules
* secretes sticky wax
* clicks its mandibles
* rears on its hind legs
* twists its tergites

## A worn stone door hangs on rusty iron hinges...

A deranged graverobber hunches under his loot bag. He carries a tattered treasure map. 

A deranged graverobber
* cackles crazily
* stabs with a long ugly knife
* grins mischievously
* shuts his eyes tight
* strokes his long, white beard
* cringes pitifully

## Bones lie scattered around a sepulchral antechamber...

Long-dead artisans chiseled ancient script on the walls.

Ancient script
* reminds you of a book you read
* recalls a bard's tale heard long ago
* looks like the engraving on a sword blade you saw once
* glows in the dim light

## Rows of reliquaries surround a moon-shaped pool...

A cave snake slithers through the water.

A cave snake
* slithers through a skull's eye socket
* tastes the air
* drips venom from its fangs
* bobs its head hypnotically
* dives into the pool
* accelerates underwater

## A threadbare tapestry hangs in a quiet hallway...

Faded colors tell a story long since forgotten.

In a threadbare tapestry
* a knight jousts a headless giant
* a maiden spins wool of a golden fleece
* a troll stuffs a pie with thirteen children
* a king wears a crown of silver fish
* three hags stir a black cauldron

## An obsidian sarcophagus rests on a marble dais...

A pressure plate triggers a spike trap.

A spike trap
* springs from the mouth of a carved lion head
* clutches the dessicated flesh of an old victim
* snicks with a whir of air
* strikes with the force of a sledgehammer blow
