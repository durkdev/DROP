# In a torn and tattered hide-bound journal forgotten in a baron's library...

I write on this fifth day of Sauine or so I think.

I am not sure I have the full measure of days down here.

Let this be my telling for all who would know how my days ended.

## We assembled under a bright moon...

...well armed and armored with three oak chests on mules for the treasure we would take. We found the gate in a hollow of the hill just as the old man said, and when the moonlight shone on the lintel runes the stone doors opened enough to drive an iron between them and pry a space big enough for a man. Falin drew the straw to guard the mules, he was none too pleased. I wonder now what he would think. He said he did not like the look of the ruined keep atop the hill. We told him we would not be long.

## They took us by surprise...

...in the third chamber after we climbed down the long well.

### The half goblin
* cranked a greasy crossbow
* shouted to his brothers in a guttural tongue
* drew a heavy curved knife
* snarled with a curse

We lost three before we drove them off, but now we were cut off from the passage back. Hagan felt a breeze and thought the left-hand passage was another way out.
