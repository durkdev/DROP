# In a torn and tattered hide-bound journal forgotten in a baron's library...

I write on this fifth day of Sauine or so I think.

I am not sure I have the full measure of days down here.

Let this be my telling for all who would know how my days ended.

## We assembled under a bright moon...

...well armed and armored with three oak chests on mules for the treasure we would take. We found the gate in a hollow of the hill just as the old man said, and when the moonlight shone on the lintel runes the stone doors opened enough to drive an iron between them and pry a space big enough for a man. Falin drew the straw to guard the mules, he was none too pleased. I wonder now what he would think. He said he did not like the look of the ruined keep atop the hill. We told him we would not be long.

## They took us by surprise...

...in the third chamber after we climbed down the long well.

### The half goblin
* cranked a greasy crossbow
* shouted to his brothers in a guttural tongue
* drew a heavy curved knife
* snarled with a curse

We lost three before we drove them off, but now we were cut off from the passage back. Hagan felt a breeze and thought the left-hand passage was another way out.

## A statue of the Mother stood in a niche in the wall...

...a stone finger touching her lips, as if commanding silence. Dain joked no command was needed in such a place. His words echoed strangely in that domed chamber. A five-pointed wayfinder's star inscribed in the floor pointed to five passages, and we took the path of Thuaidh.

## Tracks of many booted feet trampled the dust in the gallery...

We thought they were old, but could not tell for sure. One exit looked undisturbed and we went that way, the passage ramping up.

## Around a corner we came upon two hill-folk...

### The hill-folk
* were clothed in rough hides
* stabbed with short, thick spears
* blew their horns wildly

We slew them quickly, but we feared the alarm was raised. We heard cries from far off.

## Ascending a stairwell, they rushed us from a side-passage...

A trollkin led the band of hill-folk.

### A trollkin
* swung an iron-bound maul
* roared its battle cry
* gnashed its teeth in a berserk fury

Our group separated in the fight on the stairs. We could not fight through and were forced to flee down. The last I saw was Hagan locked in the trollkin's grip.

## We found a room with a door and wedged it shut...

Now we were three, one wounded badly. The cries of battle slowly faded. We kept deathly quiet. I explored the room while Ainar tended Dain. An inscription encircled the cornice, but in no script I knew. Finally my lamplight discovered a small side-door with stairs leading up. We went on.
