# In a long ago place next to some time...

## 1.

Under a night sky of the Hunter, and the Ploughman with two oxen, and the Messenger in his chariot, and the Judge with her scales, and the Shield and Necklace, and the Three Sisters, and the Orphan Children, in the middle of a hilltop on a rock a shepherd sat and watched his flock.

When Dawn strode over the horizon the shepherd rubbed his tired eyes and there on the rock for the first time he saw a crystal. He picked it up and everything changed.

## 2.

The shepherd found himself in a crystal chamber, the domed ceiling reflecting the light of lamps hanging all around.

He was all alone, and worried about his sheep.

Four passages led from the chamber, and he said to himself, "well I'm an honest man, so I'll take the way of Firin." And he went straight ahead. 

He had not gone long when he reached a door, and before it stood a crooked old man leaning on a spear.

"If you will pass," the old man said, "tell me no lies now and forevermore."

"I'm an honest man," the shepherd said.

"Have you come this way before?"

"Never have I come this way," the shepherd said.

The old man opened the door and stood aside.

He could not understand it, but he was in the same crystal chamber as before.

He wasn't getting back to his sheep any faster. "I'm a man not to waste time," he said to himself, "so I'll take the way of Uam." And he took the right-hand passage.

He had not gone long when he reached a door, and before it stood the crooked old man leaning on a spear.

"You're the same old man as before," the shepherd said.

"If you will pass," he said, "tell me no lies now and forevermore."

"I don't have time to tell you lies," the shepherd said.

"Have you come this way before?"

Truly I have not, the shepherd thought to himself. "Never have I come this way," the shepherd said.

The old man opened the door and stood aside.

Again he was in the same crystal chamber as before. Someone is playing a trick on me, the shepherd thought.

"I wish ill on no man," the shepherd said aloud, and so he took the left-hand passage of Siochan.

He had not gone long when he reached a door, and before it stood the crooked old man leaning on a spear.

"Tell me the trick, old one, for I wish to be gone!" the shepherd cried.

"If you will pass," he said, "tell me no lies now and forevermore."

"It matters not," the shepherd said, "for I know what lies beyond the door."

The old man smiled then, and suddenly stabbed the shepherd with his spear.


## 5.

The shepherd woke with a start in the mid-day bright sun, his sheep grazing all around him. The crystal was warm in his hand, and he put it in his pocket.
