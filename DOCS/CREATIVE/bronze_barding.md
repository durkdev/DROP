# Rivals skirmish to hold a bridge over an underground river...

## A half-ruined bridge-keep guards passage over the swift black water...

A dvergar in black ring-mail curses over a fallen comrade.

A dvergar
* wields an iron hammer
* wears a conical helm
* shouts for help
* circles warily

## A severed chain once held a ferry line...

A burly dvergar swings a battle-axe.

A burly dvergar
* braids his enemy's teeth into his beard
* challenges all comers
* wears on his arm a steel band of a snake eating its own tail
