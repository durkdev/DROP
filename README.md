# Welcome to Dungeon Rip-off Plus+!

We will have FISHING!! Tricks, traps and deadly Rock Paper Scissors dueling.
Stay tuned.

For a detailed specification see files in the [DOCS/DESIGN](./DOCS/DESIGN/).

Ideas for design directions as well as creative content for the future game can all be found in [DOCS/CREATIVE](./DOCS/CREATIVE)

# Current Todo list. 
This is a very rough to do list.  Feel free to edit and format in ways to indicate interest/objection help set priorities etc. If this gets messy we can switch to using other tools to track todo.  But in the meantime feel free to track other micro projects here following the example below.

## Create an EvMenu Dungeon
  A pure instanced Dungeon; see [How to Dungeon](./DESIGN/howto_dungeon.md) for an idea of what I'm going for here. 
  This will require me to re-learn evmenu.
  
  1. [X] Complete the NPC shop evmenu tutorial. (Finished for this stage.)
      1. [x] tweak the NPC shop to be usable in the game for buying gear and selling off dungeon loot.
      2. [x] add a "sell" command that turns the players inventory into a stockroom and adds an offer price to each item.
        1. [x] evemenu of personal inventory [done]
        2. [x] sell value is half of buy cost
  1. [ ] Use evmenu knowledge to build menu based combat in a linear Dungeon
      1. [ ] Dungeon choices are only continue or backtrack
      2. [ ] Dungeon feature is only monster or nothing
  1. [ ] Try to include Monster combat too.
  1. [ ] Review the results and consider whether to continue down this road.
  
  Thoughts: this would be a good place to stop and consider whether the purely instanced menu based Dungeon is good enough or whether to switch to 
  semi-permanent dungeon generation.

# DR features and long term goals, maybe.
The following features are based on the Dungeon Robber rules. They can be tweaked as we develop.

  1. Character generation command that transforms a regular character into rip-off
    artists.
      1. ability scores
      1. coins, gold, silver, copper, electrum, platinum
      1. gems etc
      1. inventory
  2. Equipment wielding - to allow player to select which equipment is active
      1. armour
      1. weapons
      1. special items like 10' pole for some reason
  3. Monsters and NPCs
      1. to fight and interact with
  4. Town - shops and services
      1. home
      2. graveyard
      3. hall of infamy
      4. market
      5. tavern
