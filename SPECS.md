# Dungeon Rip-off Plus Specifications
In which we detail the goal functionality and play experiences of this MUD.
Every section in the spec should in some way complete the sentence:
*In Dungeon Rip-off you can ...*

Some sections will go into more detail about how that gets accomplished but
the spec should not contain explicit methods or code.

# Play a character.
A D&D style character with the 6 traditional ability scores. You can 
start as a level zero dungeon rip-off artist. However under certain 
circumstances you can unlock other classes like thief, fighter, magic-user etc.

# Explore a dungeon
The main objective is procedurally generated, instanced dungeons. That means they
are random and you can never return to the same place.

However, the build commands in a MUD make it very easy to create static, permanent
dungeons too, so likely there will be a mix.

# Die frequently in different ways
So the inspiration for this project (Dungeon Robber) assumed player's characters
would die all the time. In this MUD we can discuss character persistance.
See more discussion in the section about becoming a legend.

# Find treasure
Mimicking old school D&D the main way to gain experience is to find treasure.
This game should have vast hoards of treasure for the hungry adventurer to 
discover.

# Become a legend in an imaginary town
So, in Dungeon Robber, once a character obtains sufficient wealth, they have the
option to retire. This has the effect of giving them fame and a legacy.
The town expands and services improve, new character classes are unlocked.

Since DR was a single player game it avoided the question of how this works
for multiple players.

I'm interested in whether the town itself should be instanced or if there are
other ways to simulate this experience.
